# LearnMorse
This android aplication helps you **learn morse code**. I used **Figma** for designing UI and Android Studio **Kotlin** to run it. App is only in Polish language now.

### Functionalities:
 - **Learning mode** - learn A-Z (or randomly) in morse code
 - **Training mode** - learn new 4 letters and then guess them
 -  **Test mode** - guess random letters
 - **Speed mode** - guess as many letters as possible in 20 seconds (you get 2s after correct guess)
 - **Send mode** - transmit your coded message by flashlight
 - **Info** - basic informations about app and morse code
 - **Settings** - change letter order in each mode, flashlight speed, reset your progress

### App UI design
